In this final basics folder, I used a filesystem module within "app.js" to (which is a module found within
Node.js that is used to read a file) to render an HTML file as a response. The index.html is read and then outputted
to the local port 8000 server. It's a simple program to show how to work with HTML files using Node.js.
