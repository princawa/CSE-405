        <h2>April 24 Progress Report</h2>
        <h2>Facundo Holzmeister, 004877115</h2>
        <p>Hello Profressor, for this progress report I aimed to write code for Javascript and JSON.
            I learned how to program a bit better in JavaScript by following <a href= "https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/javascript-core-language"> this quick online course.</a> 
            It provided me with the essentials and gave me a good recap on the language. I've learned how to print out a variable within a string using $().
            I also got a better understanding of the various types included in this language including objects, booleans, nulls, symbols
        </p>
        
        <p>This Javascript program that I created is really simple. Basically, it's given some constant string values 
            inputted as numbers with included symbols like (), -, specific formats. 
            Then, in the console, it will perform multiple tests to find the numbers that have parenthesis, dashes, parenthesis and/or dashes, and find a specific number formate like (###) ###-#### 
            The numbers that follow the correct statement get outputted as true. Those that are not, will output as false.
        </p>
