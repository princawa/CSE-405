This is the 1st Basics folder that I created to understand how to use Node.js. In this folder, it has a single javascript
file named "server." I managed to import an HTTP module in order to create a server that listens to a port 8000. 
Then I managed to output "Hello CSE 405 Professor. Facundo Holzmeister was here." to the browser by using a function that handles requests and responses.
