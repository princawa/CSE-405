As for the JSON, I got a bit confused on this matter, but after doing a bit of research I figured out it was a data representation format. 
Sort of like XML. In the program that I created some data which we're numbers. And then I outputted the numbers to the console using JSON.parse.
The research that I obtained mostly came from https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp
